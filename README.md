Files and scripts for openSUSE MicroOS

## /tmp on tmpfs with noexec flag

MicroOS will use tmpfs for /tmp with noexec flag set in the future.
For this reasons, salt-minion will write it's temporary files into
/run/salt-tmp.
In general, daemons should use private disk space for their data
and not shared one in /tmp.

## SELinux

MicroOS has support for SELinux.
If the file `/etc/selinux/.autorelabel` exists, the dracut module
`98selinux-microos` will label the root filesystem including
`/etc` and `/var`. The selinux-autorelabel-generator will generate
services to relabel other mountpoints during boot.

There is a script for automated testing of this in test/test.sh.

## locale-check

MicroOS supports only a limited number of locales (C, C.utf8, en_US.utf8,
POSIX). If you login via SSH, the locale settings will be verified that
they exist on this system. If not, locale is reset to the system default.

## systemd services

### setup-systemd-proxy-env.service

The `setup-systemd-proxy-env.service` makes the proxy variables from
`/etc/sysconfig/proxy` available to all systemd units.

### printenv.service

The `printenv.service` is to debug which environment variables exist
by default. It just calls `printenv`.
